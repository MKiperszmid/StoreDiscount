# StoreDiscount

This project is an implementation of the [Cabify Mobile Challenge](https://github.com/cabify/MobileChallenge), where a user can pick products from a list and checkout them to get the resulting price. The project fetches the list of products from a provided link, and applies the discounts specified in the challenge.
